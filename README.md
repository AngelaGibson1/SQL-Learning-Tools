# SQL-Learning-Tools
About This Repository

Had some free time and decided to build this out for a friend who is new to SQL, but I wanted to share it with anyone looking to learn. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user looking to refine your SQL skills, this repo provides structured SQL examples, problem-solving exercises, and best practices to help you think through queries more effectively.

At the end of this project, I'll also add an easy-to-use website where you can practice these queries interactively.



How to Use This Repository

This repository is designed to take you from basic SQL queries to advanced concepts step by step. Each section contains sample queries with explanations, real-world problems, and best practices.
